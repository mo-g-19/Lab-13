# Path for Completing Lab 13 in k21 Academy - Feature Engineeing

## Objective
*An important part of data preprocessing (raw data -> meaningful features)
Understand and able to implement techniques*
- Imputation
- Outlier Handling
- One-hot encoding
- Log transformation
- Scaling

End of the lab: Understand how to apply feature engineering techniques to optimize your ML models and ensure perform at their best

## Steps
1) ### Go through each method outlined, and gain a general understanding of purpose and implementation
    - Imputation

    - Outlier Handling

    - One-hot encoding

    - Log transformation

    - Scaling

2) #### Going through an example of each method, and understanding why it is important to use in that use case
    - Imputation
        Example:
        
    - Outlier Handling
        Example:

    - One-hot encoding
        Example:

    - Log transformation
        Example

    - Scaling
        Example: 

Each implemementation will have it's own directory to help with organizing files
